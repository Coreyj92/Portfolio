            I was born and raised on the "westend" of Evanston,Il, I fell in love with computers and technology at an early age so when I got the opportunity my senior year in high school to take an AP web design class I jumped right into it. I passed the class with an A but once i moved to Texas in 2011 I had to become an adult alot sooner than I wanted and overtime my love for technology started to fade away. In 2014 I was hired with the USPS to become a mail carrier and that is still my occupation till this day! Even though I love my job, the bonds i build with co-workers and the relationships I built with my customers on and off the clock. I'm just at a point in life where I see the decrease in business with the company also the increase of cost of living and I'm just trying to stay ahead of the curve. Now I have the opportunity to enroll back into school for the first time in over 10 years and to respark my love for technology which at the moment is bringing in a new excitement in my life even though I have days where class is cooking my brain lol. One last cool fact about me is I'M a free lance photographer! I've been doing photography and videography for about 2 years now. photography and videography allows me to invite the world into my own world, into my brain and into my vision. The art I create with my photography allows me to just be me, it allows me to show the world what my eyes see and express myself through my creativity. Photography opened up so many doors for me to be creative with music artist, athletics and event venues. A few events I was able to photograph was a concert at the house of blues and I got an invite to do photography at the Cowboys stadium for the Guinness book of world records Nerf gun battle, which was truly insane but very fun. I'm glad you clicked here to learn a few thing about me and if you're interested in my photography work feel free to click on photos and see my work! I will also provide a link to my instagram where you can stay up to date with my work!
